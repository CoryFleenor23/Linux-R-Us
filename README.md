1 - provision and EC2 instance open on port 22
    -Create a new key pair for this instance too, we will delete it later
    -SSH into the instance
    ssh -i koko.pem ec2-user@54.157.254.137

2 - Clone this Repo into the instance

4 - use a text editor(vim or nano) to open the Read.me file in your instance



5 - Create a new directory and CD into it, then create a random file and add some text into it. How can we see this text other than using vim



6 - CD back into the root directory



7 - Install Apache on the instance, making a bash script to do this.  Save your Bash Script
  - will need permissions changed too on the file remeber



8 - Verify Apache is running using the command line.  What is Apache?



9 - Go to the public IPv4 to see that Apache was installed, why can't we see it?
  - This may be a tougher question.



10 - Push the git repo to GitHub,  remember that Git and GitHub are two different things, Git was made first. There are tons of other serverices like Github



11 - Merge the branch you just pushed to your main repo on Github



12 - Terminate instance.
