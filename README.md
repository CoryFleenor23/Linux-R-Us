6 - CD back into the root directory


7 - Install Apache on the instance, making a bash script to do this.  Save your Bash Script
  - will need permissions changed too on the file remeber


8 - Verify Apache is running using the command line.  What is Apache?


9 - Go to the public IPv4 to see that Apache was installed, why can't we see it?
  - This may be a tougher question.
